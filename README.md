# Serilog.Sinks.Elmahio[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/j4rsru1m0lhkfwc4/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/serilog/serilog-sinks-elmahio/branch/master)A Serilog sink that writes events to elmah.io. [elmah.io](http://www.elmah.io) is a cloud hosted solution to capture log messages. Register for an account at their website and use the provided GUID in the configuration for Serilog.**Package** - [Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIO](http://nuget.org/packages/serilog.sinks.ElmahIO)| **Platforms** - .NET 4.5```csharpvar log = new LoggerConfiguration()    .WriteTo.ElmahIO(new Guid("{your guid}"))    .CreateLogger();```The sink captures all levels, but respect the minimum level configured on LoggerConfiguration. Serilog properties are converted to elmah.io's concept of custom variables, when logging new events.
